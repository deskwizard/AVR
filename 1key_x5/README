	V-USB HID 1 key keyboard example with status LED

	Demonstrate a 1 key USB HID keyboard with the use of V-USB 
	on an ATTINY45/85 using the internal oscillator tuned at 16.5mHz
 

 	A button press toggles between sending 'W' (Left shift + w) and idle states
	

	USB states, LEDs and button GPIOs are configured in defines.h

	Default GPIOs assignment are as follows:
		LED0 	PB3
		LED1	PB0
		KEY0	PB4

		LED0 follows the USB states, on while sending keys and off when idle.
		LED1 is the Status LED and is configured as NUM_LOCK LED by default.
		KEY0 is a momentary push button in an active low configuration.


 	Available keycodes, modifiers and status LEDs definitions are located in keycodes.h
	
	Please note that not all keycodes are defined, see link in keycodes.h
	for complete USB HID keycodes table.
